# Analysis

We will be conducting an analysis on school district data by looking for trends, doing comparisons, and coming to conclusions to help the school board and city mayor improve the schools.

--Written Report--

Our goal is to help the school board and city mayor decide the best plan of action, and where to best allocate their resources to obtain the best possible results for the schools and the school district. We will be taking a look at the school district performances by looking at the reading and math scores.
When we take a look at the school district performance we see that math performances are lower than reading, with ~75% and ~86% passing, respectively. The overall performance is at 65%, which tells us the percentage of students who have passing scores in both reading and math. We will be analyzing the data to find the best action to take to increase these numbers.

After completing our data analysis, we can see the drastic differences between charter schools and district schools. charter schools are better in every category when it comes to reading, math, and overall passing. The top 5 school performers are all charter, and the bottom 5 are all district schools. With this, we can conclude that charter schools have better performances than district schools.

Next we will take a look into the school's budget. Based off the data, we can see that the bigger budget doesn't neccessarily lead to better performances. In fact, it seems like the opposite it true. Even when we break it down into per student budget, the same is still true. With this, we can conclude that increasing the budget will not affect school performances.

With this, we can go to the school board and city mayor and tell them about our conclusion. That being, charter schools perform better than district schools, and increasing the school budget will not directly affect school performance.
